This is the source code in running heterogeneous vehicle simulation of trucks and jeepneys with passengers and stops.

For the Load Anywhere Behavior folders, run the scripts "simulation_multiprocessing.py", each corresponding to a PT lane implementation setups.

"simulation_multiprocessing.py" - Control set up
"simulation_multiprocessing2.py" -  Outer lane truck ban, both lanes open to jeeps
"simulation_multiprocessing3.py"  - Inner lane jeepney ban, both lanes open to trucks
"simulation_multiprocessing4.py" - Mutually - exclusive lanes


For the Evenly-Spaced stops, run the scripts that have the same naming convention as the load anywhere behavior but with additional "evenly_spaced_stops" on its names.

The randomly-spaced stops is an unfinished source code. It still results to errors and have to debugged --
