    "In this case, we will try two lane roads. We do a simple case of a two lane roads intersection. Town-Road-On-Ramp intersection. In this case, vehicles are produced at the start of the town road. It moves along the town road until it reaches the end. The intersection is then checked for an available space. If there are available spaces for the vehicle, it is transferred to the intersection. When it reaches the end of intersection, it becomes a candidate of transfer to the on-ramp. If there's avaialable space, it is transferred and moved along the on-ramp. When it reaches the end of the ramp, it is forced to stop to pay for the toll fees. "
